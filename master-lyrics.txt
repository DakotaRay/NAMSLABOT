I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship...

And I know soon come my time
For in mine void a pale horse burns
But I fear not the time I'm taken
Past the point of no return.
Wage war like no tomorrow
Cuz no hell there won't be one
For all who deny the struggle
The triumphant overcome

Trips to where, few have been
Out of thin air, upon high winds
Rites begin when the sun descends
Have felt what few will ever know
Have seen the truth beneath the glow,
Of the ebb and flow, where roots of all mysteries grow
I am below, so far below
The bottom line
Transmitting live, transmissions rise
From the depths out of controlled by
Suspended glance of an unblinking eyes
Imminent gaze cast 'pon the path that winds
'Pon the path I find, and claim as mine
To ride the waves, of unrest
Made to make me shine as a testament
To why the ways of the blind will never get
Shit but shanked by my disrespect
Dismiss this life, worship death
Cold blood night of serpent's breath
Exhaled like spells from the endlessness
In the bottomless wells of emptiness
Channeled to invoke what we represent

Secret order
Elitist horde of
Creeping fire
Seizing power
Riders of the lupus hour
Eye on palm
Time is gone
Moonlight drawn
Fly til dawn
Sacrifice to rise beyond
Deep inside the violent calm
Of the coming storm
In blood sworn
To glorify and for life adorn
With all that dies to become unborn

I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship...
I am the beast I worship

In the time before time eyes 'bove which horns
Curve like psychotropic scythes
And smell of torn flesh bled dry
By hell swarms of pestis flies
Vomiting forth flames lit by
An older than ancient force
That slays this life with no remorse

The spiral storm
Of flames inside
The torch I raise
The force I ride

Feel my vessel go up in flames
Flesh torch lit by thee unnamed
Direct connection to the source
Vestment of unnatural force
Forever burning black torch
Wisdom of the old and true
Possessed by the chosen few
Shining to reveal the ways
Of a darkness that pervades
All that is and ever was
Inferno of witches blood

Worship is not on bended knee
Nature knows not of mercy
To pray is to accept defeat
Power pisses on the weak
Bow and beheaded by the beast
Beggar on a bitches leash
Scum is desperate for relief
Worship is the way I ride
Witching currents through the eye
Of storms that force the false to die
Worship the flames with which I rise
Into apocalyptic skies

Harsh winds flay mine flesh to bone
In splintered skeleton I roam
Wastelands with not to call my own
But the path I walk alone
The hunger burns, within my gut
As my bones turn into dust

And I know soon come my time
For in mine void a pale horse burns
But I fear not the time I'm taken
Past the point of no return
Wage war like no tomorrow, know well there wont we one
For all who deny the struggle
The triumphant overcome ...

I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship...
I am the beast I worship 


It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes
Guillotine yuh

Sit in the dark and ponder how I'm fit to make the bottom fall through the floor
And they all fall down   yah

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...
Guillotine yuh

Out of the shadows barrage of witch tongue
Cobra spit over apocalyptic cult killer cauldron smoke
Stomp music seriously   yah

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...
Guillotine     yuh

Can't stop the groove lics jaws clear off them locks relentless raw movement
Fit to knock you from here to that g-spot body rock connected

To everything you want, ever did want
We got it why not come get it, stick your head in that hole
And watch me drop this cold guillotine death sentence yuh

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...
Guillotine yuhh

Hidden art, between and beneath, every fragmented, figure of speech,
Tongue in reverse, whenever the beat, causes my jaws to call
Out out out out yah

The screens flashing red, can't see shit but heads
Spinning exorcist like planets
Out of orbit off the edge
Off mine axis whipping through doors to far more than all that’s ever been said - yah

Tie the chord kick the chair and your dead    yah

Yah ... guillotine yuh ... guillotine yah

Head of a trick in a bucket
Body of a trick in a bag
And thrown in the fire like fuck it
Gotta burn it before it goes bad
One too many times been disgusted
By the stench of rot is such a drag  yah

Get broke by the street like blood stained glass 
Choke on these nuts til the very last yuh

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...
Guillotine yah

Serial number, killing machine
The illest of means,
To an end built on the filthy sound
you're experiencing  yah

It goes, it goes, it goes, it goes...
Guillotine yuh

Tinted windows, bulletproof
The slip knot fixin rope to noose
To the grave stone grinder of cold steel

The passion that blinds me so I feel  YAH

Can't let go, no it flows through our veins
Blows through our tunnels and rattles our chains
And they all fall down - yah

I fuck the music
I make it cum
I fuck the music with my serpent tongue

Wanna beer, have no fear, comes and goes, man its here
No one knows, feels so weird, when it blows through my bones
I got a jones for it
I wanna know more, cuz its bout what I got to show for it

I want some more of it
I want too much
I got so bored with it
I shot it up
Wanna light my torch with it and get all fucked up

What is it, where is it
How will it affect me
Fuck that shit, I need that shits bound to be the death of me
Fuck buying it I'm taking it, and sharing it with nobody

Cuz all I really need is some cool shit to mob
Like driving down the street to the beat of a blow job

I own that shit
On some throw back shit
You already know that shit
You even know 'bout how I know the man
Who grows that, bitch 
You can't buy it with your money
You can't find it overseas
Its one of those things that seems outlandish
Til you have it's not a dream
As for me, I'm cool with it
And that's alright cuz it's my thing.

Work that angle til its beveled
Curve of the blade doubled
Edge made to bleed the struggle
Best believe the game's a hustle.
Observer of the strange occurrences
Conjurer of the subtle
Unseen but felt disturbances
That burst a bitches bubble

That’s right it's all mine
It’s all mine never was yours
Like how you wait in line
While I walk straight through the door

Hear you say something
But ain't nothing – spectators ignored
Pay no mind to that chump's
Just a player hatin whore

I fuck the music
I make it cum
I fuck the music with my serpent tongue

Ain’t no fun if the aliens can't have none

How I fuck it dirty
How I make it twitch and scream
How it screams oh baby hurt me
Work me to the bone oh please
How I bend the rhythm over
And hit, hit, hit it on my knees
Give, give, give it up
I need it all the time
Bleed it on the drop of a dime – down to pound it til it shines
Moonlit lake of blood red wine
Make no mistake, I makes it mine

Break shit down and make it grind
To the groove used to align
The cascading shades of jaded blues with these rhymes
Nuclear steeze creeps and winds
Through secrets behind and between
Every time I scream

Shit is mine
Its all mine
All the time
Shit is mine

What is it, where is it, how will it affect me
Fuck that shit I need that shit

Thought you knew, thought you thought
Thought you did but did not
Come on through what you got
Is it cool is it hot?

Check one two, man don't stop
I'm not through black blood clot
In my view like that twat
Spread eagle cross the block

Need no ego to rock
What we know just gets dropped
How we keep shit on lock

Cuz all I really need is some cool shit to mod
Like driving down the street to the beat of a blow job

Shit is mine
Its all mine
All the time
Shit is mine


Goin' back to Tangier
With some jordans and a spear
Post-Christian shit
Post chicken or the egg addiction shit
Pass the sherm stick
Neo-reality
Be the freak you wanna see
Just don't follow me
I'm on a journey to the center of three
Grab your fucking chain and drag you through the bike lane
While everybody's like no

I got this pregnant snake
Stay surrounded by long hairs
A plethora of maniacs and spiral stairs
Make your water break in the apple store
Sink or swim, who fucking cares
Cut the birth cords, press send
Yeah thick
Gaga can't handle this shit

Headed for the Sammy Davis wing
Throw up a black hole at the entrance of linens n things on the way
Never call it a day
Visit Tesla's grave for the ninth time today
Still on the way
Bigger wigs

When you come out your shit is gone
When you come out your shit is gone
When you come out your shit is gone
When you come out your shit is gone
I'm in your area, I'm in your area
I'm in your area, I'm in your area
I know the first three numbers, I'm in 
I know the first three numbers, I'm in 
I'm in your area, I'm in your area 
I'm in your area, I'm in your area 
I know the first three numbers, I'm in

You'll catch a jpeg to the head, über reach
You're an intern on Wiki Leaks
Most loved therefore most hated
Come and knock on the door we've been waiting for you
Game changer
Reclusive aggressive
Yinging and yanging noided
Info warrior jack the hacker
The rolling stoner
Profit on disaster

My existence is a momentary lapse of reason
Got the DNA of Gothic lemons
Shred it thirteen times out of eleven
Your bad ideas are the ATM
Shed my skin
Leave it for the homeless to sleep it
Prodigal, fuck that nautical
Teachin' bitches how to swim

I'm in your area, I'm in your area
I'm in your area, I'm in your area
I know the first three numbers, I'm in 
I know the first three numbers, I'm in 
I'm in your area, I'm in your area 
I'm in your area, I'm in your area 
I know the first three numbers, I'm in 
I know the first three numbers, I'm in 
Teachin' bitches how to swim
I'm in
Teachin' bitches how to swim

Now backstroke
Through your k-hole
Don't run
Ya might slip
The table's flipped now we got all the coconuts bitch

Burmese babies under each arm
Screamin' beautiful songs
The cray cray ultra contrarion
Havin' conversations with your car alarm
When you come out your shit is gone
Soon your crew will be servin' sandwiches named after me
Vietnamese style fool, please

Front row at the mass games
Untraceable by name
You speak of us in certain circles you will be dethroned or detained
Gone, gone
Your shit is gone, gone
When you come out your shit is gone

I'm in your area, I'm in your area
I'm in your area, I'm in your area
I know the first three numbers, I'm in 
I know the first three numbers, I'm in 
I'm in your area, I'm in your area 
I'm in your area, I'm in your area 
I know the first three numbers, I'm in 
I know the first three numbers, I'm in 

How the trip never stops
On and on, it's beyond insane
Why I set myself up
In a raging sea of flames?

You're fit to learn the proper meaning of a beatdown
Madness, chaos in the brain
Let my blood flow, make my blood flow through you, mane
You got no business questioning a thang

Never not on it, leanin' so hard you're ashamed
You can't dismiss this sick transmission, huffs your brain
Exhale your will and forget I ever knew you
Fuck do you do?
Fuck a man with hips for hulu
Rack a snitch, chalk and cue you
Corner pocket consume you
Too many hoes in my
Too many hoes in my motherfuckin' meal
Asking if I know how a motherfucker feels
How a motherfucker feels
Slit them choke, flip them boat
Dead bitch float, swollen corpse
No remorse, navigated off course
Off course I can make you scream but if you ask for more
Bullshit, matador, grab the floor, whip it cracked to all fours
You whimper while I check my phone
Who's next? Assassin roam
Music drifts, I have no home
Choose this life you're on your own

Swallowed way too much
Couldn't handle it, I fell
Down a spiral stair case winding to hell

Fuck it, now I can't quit, will never be the same
I got that attitude, you got no thang
I'm fit to hurt you; gives a fuck about the way I move weight?
Dark matter, flu state of consciousness
Blew straight through you won't do shit
But beg me to do this
Again and again and again and again
Strangler clutch, sine wave deconstruct
My way or no way, bangin' hey makin' lust
Lucid nut shake shake it up
Booyakah
You're a bitch made to be crushed
Came like, what
Now you crave my, touch
Flat busted on front street cake cuppin'
Say you wasn't lion mane
I done been done with tame
Head hunter, fuck the fame
Switch lanin' ripper slangin'
Hit me nuclear wind at my back
Smokin' goldfish at the photo mat
Load my clap clap can't trust 'em never did
What it is?
